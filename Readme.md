Movie Analysis Project

Overview
This project explores a dataset of movies and performs an in-depth analysis of budget, revenue, movie franchises, directors, and trends over time.

The goal is to uncover insights such as:
* Which franchises perform best
* Budget vs. revenue relationships
* Trends across decades
* Top-performing directors
* Yearly averages and patterns

All analysis is conducted inside the Movie_Analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 **Key Analysis Steps**

### **1. Data Loading & Cleaning**

* Load raw dataset (CSV)
* Handle missing values
* Convert date columns to datetime
* Compute additional features (profit, decade, etc.)

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Summary statistics
* Correlation between budget and revenue
* Visualization of distributions

### **3. Franchise Analysis**

* Group movies by franchise
* Calculate:

  * total movie count
  * average budget
  * total revenue
  * average revenue

### **4. Director Analysis**

* Rank directors based on:

  * number of movies
  * total revenue
  * average revenue

### **5. Yearly Trends**

* Compute yearly means for:

  * budget
  * revenue
* Plot trends using line charts

### **6. Insights & Conclusions**

Examples:

* Which franchises are most profitable
* Changes in movie spending over the years
* Revenue evolution
